# This is just a fun game of Rock / Paper / Scissors

You are playing against the computer which generates its own random choice of rock/paper/scossors.

## The programme accepts 3 valid inputs:

- 'r'  for (r)ock
- 'p'  for (p)aper
- 's'  for (s)cissors

It also checks for invalid input.

Finally it counts the total number of wins and losses.

The game ends when the user does not 'OK' to play another game and clicks Cancel.

If you don't believe the game is fair and want to see both your and the computer's choices, open the Console in your browser to see the choices printed as the game goes along.

Have fun!
